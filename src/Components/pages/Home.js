There are more than a crore stray cattle while there is shelter and food for not even 10 per cent of these animals â€” and no resources for this purpose. In the Delhi-NCR region, more than 200 cows and bulls die every year due to lack of such resources. Our purpose is to save or preserve these stray and dairy cattles as much as possible. We are also teaching new art to women residing in rural areas called " Waste to art." which also provides employment to rural women. Nonetheless, with regards to plants, wreck isn't the main expected disaster, plants can be toxic and a peril to your kids whenever ingested. To solve that we are also giving a non toxic plant food to plant parents.</HomeSection>
