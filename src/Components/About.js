        <p>Homeless steers are a major and genuine challenge.Around 8 million lost steers are meandering Streets. They influence the cultivating, decimate the yields and fields. They become a reason for many accidents on the streets. The farmers use their cattles for thier own personal benefits. The moment they stop producing milk, they leave them. We're using the waste of Non Dairy cattles to develop our product and that product is helping the indoor plants.
